# DashStack | Dashboard

A simple dashboard application for managing business or website operations. It is not ready to be real yet because there are some features that are missing and will be implemented later. I've worked on this project just for testing and fun, neither more nor less .

## Technologies Used :
- **React**
- **Next.js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Chart.js**
- **Redux - Redux Toolkit**

## Features :
- **Fully Responsive:** Responsive across different screen sizes
- **High Performance:** Performance Optimization is crucial for this kind of applications and for any website acctually
- **User Experience:** The main focus during development was to ensure an excellent user experience
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Works seamlessly across various browsers

## Please Note :
 - #### All data in this project is just a placeholder data and can be replaced with a real data later.
 - #### If you do not trust me when I told you that this project is fully responsive and you went to test the responsiveness yourself and faced an issue , well, you deserve that... Why the hell do you think I would make a project that is not responsive? Anyway... IF you faced any issue, just refresh the page and everything will work. Magic, right? Well, I don’t even know what is causing this issue, but anyway just remember to refresh.

## Design :
This dashboard was Converted from a Figma design:
